# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
PH was concerned with planning for a coming "Silver Tsunami" of retirements and need to build infrastructure to help organize the data in planning for the future of their firm.  By moving spreadsheets to SQL, PH will be able to identify employees that will soon retire as well as develop a pipeline of mentorship candidates for the future.

## Results
Overall, 85,896 employees were identifed as part of the "Silver Tsunami".
- 29,414 Senior Engineers
- 28,254 Senior Staff
- 14,222 Engineers
- 4,502 Technique Leaders
- 1,761 Assistant Engineers
- 2 Managers
<br>
By reworking the query we used to aggregate the retirement candidates, we can also identify mentorship candidates were also identified, illustrating a large shortfall in internal candidate to elevate in the future:
- 579 Staff
- 569 Senior Staff
- 550 Engineers
- 529 Senior Engineers
- 78 Assistant Engineers
- 77 Technique Leaders

## Summary
### Roles that will need to be filled?
Every title category we utilized in this analysis will need significant rehiring in future years.
### Are there enough retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation of employees?
There are more than enough employees based on the data shown in the results section, but regardless of career progression paths, there is a massive shortfall of candidates to elevate into those roles for almost every title within PH.
